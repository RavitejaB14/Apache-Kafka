# Apache-Kafka

Apache kafka: A High throughput distributed messaging system.

Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform used to collect, process, store, and integrate data at scale. It has numerous use cases including distributed logging, stream processing, data integration, and pub/sub messaging.

Events: An event is any type of action, incident, or change that's identified or recorded by software or applications. For example, a payment, a website click, or a temperature reading, along with a description of what happened.

Kafka models events as key/value pairs. Internally, keys and values are just sequences of bytes, but externally in your programming language of choice, they are often structured objects represented in your languageâ€™s type system.

Kafka famously calls the translation between language types and internal bytes serialization and deserialization. The serialized format is usually JSON, JSON Schema, Avro, or Protobuf.

Both Key and values pairs are just sequence of bytes.
