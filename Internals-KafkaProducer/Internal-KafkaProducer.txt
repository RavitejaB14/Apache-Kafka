When Producer sends messages

See Kafka-producer.png file

Here 0,1,2,3,4 are nothing but offsets (Sequence Id)

Messages are stored in Partitions inform of Offsets. It helps in Identifying the messages 


Offsets:

The records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called "offset" that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.

Three Variations of partition:

1. Log-end Offset: Offset of the last messages written to the partition. (P0 -> 3, P1 -> 2, P3 -> 2)
2. Current Offset: Pointer to the last record that kafka has already sent to consumer in the most recent poll.
3. Committed Offset: Marking an offset as consumed is called committing an offset(Committed Offset).


Kafka Producer: Sends message with two fields

Key : Used to send message based on partition level. If we give key value, then Messages will go to that particular partition.

If key is null, then messages will be sent in round robin fashion for each partition.
Payload: Message

In the partition level, In addition to key and payload, It will also stored
key
